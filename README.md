CDB.NET
=======

Constant Database for .NET

CDB.NET is a pure C# version of D.J. Bernstein’s constant database (cdb) package.
This port was created from Java port of Michael Alyn Miller http://www.strangegizmo.com/products/sg-cdb/.
Files created with CDB.NET can be read with the cdb library and vice versa.
My goal was to provide a seamless way of porting cdb code to a .NET environment without the need for calling native code.
CDB.NET fits the bill and can be used anywhere a read-only database is needed.

More cdb information can be found at D.J. Bernstein’s home page: http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html.
Please do not send CDB.NET questions to Mr. Bernstein. He is not the maintainer of this implementation.
You are more than welcome to send me any questions you may have.
